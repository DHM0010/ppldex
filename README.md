# HPDex

## DESCRIPTION

This application allows users to create a personalized account where they can build and save their own custom Harry Potter characters, the characters can either be canon characters or ones of their own creation. With an intuitive user interface, users can craft characters by selecting a house, assigning unique traits and skills, and giving their characters personalized names and backgrounds, all while ensuring data is securely stored and user passwords are hashed using bcrypt.

## USAGE

You must create an account and login to access the rest of the site (except the homepage).

![Login page for HPdex]()

From there you'll be automatically directed to your personal dashboard which will show existing characters, if you have any, and a button to Create New Character.

You may also delete existing characters from your dashboard.

Edit to existing character profile's is a future development.

![Dashboard page for HPdex]()

Selecting Create New Character leads you to an input form where you can provide a character name, bio, 6 stats, and 6 skills.

![Create Character page for HPdex]()

The stats are based on Hogwart subjects so think about where your character strength and weaknesses lay in their subjects and provide a number between 1 (weakest) and 15 (strongest) for their level.

The skills can be anything from known spells, special magical abilities, or even potions they can make flawlessly.

From there, submit the form and it will direct you back to your dashboard with the new character showing!

To see existing character information, just select one of the character names you will see the characters individual profile.
